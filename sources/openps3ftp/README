ftp commands and also supports most ftp clients. It has some compliance to the ftp RFC.

To compile the source, you will need the PSL1GHT homebrew SDK installed on your computer.
Version 1 of the SDK is required to compile versions prior to v2.2, and version 2 of the
SDK is required for v2.2 and later.
