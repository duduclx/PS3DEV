x Instanced rendering

x Framebuffer objects

x glMapBuffer* should block if an operation on the buffer is still pending.

- Better-performing glMapBuffer.

- Less conservative approach to buffer mapping & GPU cache invalidation.

- (Finish) object "orphaning"
  - Programs orphanable
  - Disposal of orphaned objects

- Flushing and orphan cleanup policy

x Handle timestamp overflow

- Integer vertex specification.

Textures:
- format conversion (take this from mesa).
- test mipmapping
- cube maps
- rectangular textures
x implement glTexStorage*()
- implement glCopyTexImage*() and glCopyTexSubImage*()
- proxy textures
- implement the effects of glPixelStore

- Support for GLES2-style client vertex data.

- Support for GLES2-style application object namespaces.

- Implement glGet*() functions.

- More GLSL support.

- Make it possible to work with non-EGL configured display.

x Move object storage from globals to context.

- Support multiple contexts with shared objects.

- __restrict keyword where appropriate.

x Add libstdc++.a to libGL.a, so that client code doesn't need to use g++ to
  link.

- oglsamples

x Vertex program textures

x Query objects
