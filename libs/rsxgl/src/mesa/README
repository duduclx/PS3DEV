The files in this directory are used to get Mesa's 8.0 branch to work
with RSXGL. Currently, Mesa is used by RSXGL to compile GLSL programs
and to translate textures between various formats.

RSXGL supports out-of-source builds, so its configure script uses the
"files" file to copy Mesa's source tree to a build directory. "patch"
contains a few changes to Mesa's source itself.

Mesa's build system gets modified so that the GLSL builtin functions
compiler can be built and run on the system used to build RSXGL.

The "src/" directory contains headers for a few functions not included
in the PS3 homebrew toolchain (notably dlopen() and friends).

RSXGL modifies the sources contained in Mesa's
src/gallium/drivers/{nouveau,nvfx}. The modified versions are kept
elsewhere in RSXGL's source tree; Mesa's versions of these do not get
built.
