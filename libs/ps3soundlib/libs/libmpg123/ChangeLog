	  of libmpg123 but this way it has the best possible quality and

	  mpg123 way! Plus, if your hardware doesn't support many rates or
	  you really, really want your CPU do the work, just use an output
	  module like alsa with default (plughw) device or portaudio that
	  will do the resampling in software. That being said... I just

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/parse.c: A hack to loosen stream check
	  strictness... discarding the first header on resync. That at
	  least enables playback of the test file of bug 1889051 ... but
	  may introduce other false positives again. Actually, the problem
	  of 1889051 is a false positive for the fist header; which
	  _passes_ the text for a following valid header after that frame.
	  What a coincidence... Should I test for the next 2 frames?
	  MPlayer doesn't show the short distortion that mpg123 shows in
	  decoding the first (invalid, but strangely decodable) frame.
	  Guess the best to do is to finally rewrite that frame
	  reading/searching function to be more consistent and tunable for
	  - bytes of junk to skip - resync limit (we have that already) -
	  number of frames/headers readahead for assuring a valid stream I
	  would like to have a 1.2.1 release with just the last bugfix
	  (endless loop in resync) and perhaps a variant of the current
	  hack after I spent some more thought and testing on it (does
	  mpg123 still pass the nasty test files that made me make the
	  resync that strickt?). Then, for 1.3.0, the tunable resync
	  should enter the scene.

2007-12-08 02:46  thor

	* trunk/src/mpg123.c, trunk/src/term.c: Fix buffer behaviour with
	  seeking, in the only way that seemed workable: When you press a
	  seek key in buffer mode, the buffer is stopped and you can seek
	  in peace to your position (makes most sense to have verbosity
	  turned on). After reaching the position, you have to press the
	  stop/un-stop key to restart playback. Seeking wile listening to
	  the bits passing by is really, really non-trivial with the
	  buffer because of the timing between keypress repeats and the
	  buffer refilling. When you want it really interactive, you don't
	  want to have the buffer in between... I think the current
	  solution is close to a local optimum for this, it's the tradeoff
	  you have to do. Even seeking _inside_ the buffer won't help
	  seeking backwards, as the refill would kick in in the same way.

2007-12-08 01:20  thor

	  trunk/src/xfermem.h: More communicative buffer and normalized
	  usage of which. No nastly killing or SIGSTOP anymore; buffer
	  either plays or waits for commands, including termination. This
	  fixes the terminal behaviour with track skip and seek when
	  stopped: The buffer can be resynced while being stopped, so no
	  forced restart of playback on track skip anymore. The only
	  nagging usability issue remaining with the buffer is the
	  inability to seek while playing. Refilling of the buffer effects
	  in fast-forward only.

	  works normally, v19 just wants to block or segfault on my box.

	* trunk/src/audio.c, trunk/src/audio.h, trunk/src/buffer.c,

	  rework, mainly to clean up the mess with the buffer. The initial
	  reason was to install safeguards against multiple ao->close()
	  operations, which was done, too. Now either the buffer or the
	  main mpg123 process touch the audio devices; in the buffered
	  case the main program querying the buffer process for audio
	  capabilities. That and some other potential bug(s) fixed. This
	  is too much movement in a release candidate, but it is necessary
	  - we want some quality for 1.0!

	  it ESD, perhaps only ESD people themselves say ESounD...). Also,
	  to keep all audio output code in the distribution and to ease

	  Worked on the win32 crash... found out that the access to the
	  exported (?!) array mpg123_rates[] and/or mpg123_encodings[]
	  blows with the DLL. Exporting functions to access the arrays
	  instead seems to work; and is generally the better way, perhaps.
	  So there is an API change from mpg123_rates[] to
	  mpg123_rates(const long **, size_t *) and likewise for
	  mpg123_encodings. Along with the win32 hacking I actually
	  enabled the EXPORT define stuff, but this made no difference
	  anyway (I guess libtool just uses libmpg123.sym and that's it).
	  Another issue, interwoven but unrelated (sorry...) is the
	  hacking of autotool stuff to omit C++, F77 compiler tests that
	  libtool macros trigger. A future version of libtool shall be
	  fixed and won't need these hacks.

2007-12-04 10:54  thor

	  I should really just let these pointers point to an empty string
	  when there is no info? Even if there is an empty string, the
	  fill should be >0 because of the closing zero. So a string with
	  p[0] = 0, size=1 and fill=0 could be a safe alternative to

	  -Wno-error into CFLAGS doesn't really work (not properly, at
	  least)... and also the exiting working with CFLAGS that
	  influence the foolowing tests in configure was not good. Now we
	  are a bit more careful with the mods (also redirecting -DSTUFF
	  to CPPFLAGS instead of CFLAGS) and there is a blocker check at
	  beginning. configure will just fail when there is -Werror in the
	  flags, because it is really bad with several tests. Note that
	  this also implies that make distcheck will always fail in this
	  controlled way when run after a configure that generated CFLAGS
	  with -Werror. These generated CFLAGS are carried over to the

	  more info directly accessible; which id3dump now does access -
	  adapted id3print.c to the pointer thing (by dropping some & ;-)

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/readers.c: Ok, changed the check
	  in read_frame back to comparig the new header with first and old

	  negatives but still allows seeking in this one evil file at all.
	  Blind seeking in vbr files is evil.

2006-08-17 07:38  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/common.h, trunk/src/readers.c:
	  Started workign on the seeking (and fixed the second-time id3v2
	  recognition to happen in quiet mode , too, by the way). The
	  seeking is a mess but necessarily so for vbr files that we don't
	  have a frame mapping for (from Xing header - not used atm,
	  though). Now the seeking at least works for this one very vbr
	  file (where no frame is like the first!) where formerly any
	  seekl lead directly to end-of-track. There is a tradeoff: Now we
	  get false positives from time to time. We should treat
	  Xing-tagged vbr files with all the info we have and at least
	  warn about vbr files that lack the seeking info.

2006-08-17 00:06  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/common.h,
	  trunk/src/control_generic.c: One place to calculate current

	* trunk/src/httpget.c, trunk/src/mpg123.c, trunk/src/mpg123.h,

	  (for the host header field because of virtual hosts support) but
	  retreated after realizing that one has to accept chunked data -
	  now still HTTP/1.0 with host header as extension (as before,
	  actually), also again sending only absolute paths as requests
	  (no full url) but still allowing relative redirects - using the
	  content-type header field to prevent playback of wrong codec and
	  to more safely recognice playlist files - one result: for a
	  single we resource one can always use the -@ switch: playlists
	  are treated as playlists and if it is an audio/mpeg file, it is
	  reopened as such - added most simple parsing of pls (shoutcast)
	  playlists

	  devices (well, this could be extended to a general scheme to
	  choose between different driver subsystems via -a system:file or
	  system:device:file ...) - corrected the error handling: -1 is
	  expected on error by mpg123.c - giving help message with list of
	  available drivers when invalid one is specified I verified with
	  one testfile that -a wav:file does the same as -w file. I think
	  that this is good;-) Also, I'd like to mention that it's nice to
	  measure audio subsystem overhead with comparing -t and -a null.

	  to really get it

2006-07-06 14:00  thor

	* buglog/mathias_wenzel_stress.txt, trunk/src/common.c,
	  trunk/src/layer3.c: Fixed the mpeg2.5 verdict in common.c (we
	  have to check support for this); made parts of layer3.c more
	  robust based on an evil mp3 (see the buglog file). Most
	  important featur of this robustness could be that mpg123 doesn't
	  simply exit() in wrong sideinfo anymore but tries to continue.

	* trunk/TODO, trunk/src/httpget.c: Revised my bugfix for the last
	  GLSA issue after suggestion by Daniel Kobras (allow longer
	  redirection urls than request url), spent some time hacking
	  further ... and: - fixed unnoticed memory leak in redirection
	  (malloc without free for assigned pointer) - now accepting
	  non-absolute redirects; request now is always of the form GET
	  http://host/path HTTP/1.0 (non-absolute relocations are related
	  to this request) That also works flawlessly with my virtual
	  domain setup on my server used in the test. - decided that this
	  whole file is evil; we need to rewrite that properly

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/layer3.c, trunk/src/layer3.h,
	  trunk/src/mpg123.c: Again reworked the gapless stuff... should
	  be more efficient now and also more aggressive by just skipping
	  decoder delay even if no info found and also adding decoder
	  delay to end (hm, where does this really make sense without
	  padding removal?). It should be more efficient now; a comparison
	  between linux-x86 binary (pentium) with and without gapless code
	  shows perhaps around 0.2% speed penalty through added code -
	  which already melts when gapless mode is actually active.
	  Generally on speed: comparison with 0.59r (linux build,
	  non-marched cflags (pentium2)) shows around 2% slower decoding
	  for svn trunk; but this is greatly compensated by using one of
	  the new assembler optimizations. Still, I see much code that can
	  be improved also for efficiency alone by clearing the situation
	  with some (shared) variables that don't need to be passed around
	  all the time...

2006-07-03 12:55  thor

	* trunk/src/Makefile.legacy, trunk/src/common.c,

	  trunk/src/layer3.c, trunk/src/layer3.h, trunk/src/mpg123.c,
	  trunk/src/mpg123.h: Main message: The gapless mode has been
	  enhanced to work more low-level (in layer3.c) and also to use
	  the Xing-given frame count to get the end straight. It should
	  work (tested, but not in every detail) both with the -k option
	  and terminal controlled seeking as well as control_generic
	  JUMPs. The current implementation adds some load that could be
	  reduced by putting the gapless checker code into behind flush
	  check instead of before but that needs additional care for track
	  end (where audio_flush is called externally). Apart from that
	  and some needed de-uglification it should be a nicely working
	  feature. Minor messages: frameNum is unsigned long (so bigger
	  that int and never < 0!); some parts of mpg123.c and common.c
	  did not honor these truths. But I don't claim that I catched all
	  occurences of such problems - see BUGS. Also, I fixed stuff in
	  print_stat with weird frame number estimations. Looks _much_
	  better now esp. when the frame count is known from Xing tag.

	  removing -D flags from generic target since they don't
	  compile... so many targets...

2006-06-12 00:21  thor

	* trunk/common.c: Finally got around to fix playback of that
	  dreaded file with a BMP (not "unsynched") in ID3V2 tag. Partial
	  backport from mhipp's trunk; now just ignoring the number of
	  bytes indicated by id3v2 frame header.

2006-06-04 20:26  thor

	* trunk/mpg123.c: The equalizer control patch just duplicated code
	  that got executed twice when usning an equalfile. Fixed that.

2006-05-14 11:30  thor

	* trunk/CHANGES, trunk/Makefile, trunk/decode_i386.c,
	  trunk/httpget.c, trunk/layer3.c, trunk/mpg123.c, trunk/mpg123.h,
	  trunk/version.h: - applied relevant stuff from Debian's 22: -
	  fix for CVE-2006-1655 (buffer overflow in III_i_stereo()) -
	  strict aliasing hack in WRITE_SAMPLE of decode_i386.c - fixed
	  http streaming through proxy by actually using the request
	  url... - buffer resync on Ctrl-C (cleaning, reducing pauses with
	  multiple files) - removed unused esdserver variable from
	  mpg123.h - did NOT apply the Debian Makefile/manpage changes
	  (going to rewrite that stuff anyway) - made the netbsd-i386
	  targets visible as netbsd-x86

2006-05-11 15:26  thor

	* trunk/version.h: forgot that

	* trunk/CHANGES, trunk/Makefile, trunk/mpg123.c: netbsd targets
	  with and without realtime stuff (that seems to need -lpthread...)

	* trunk/lgpl/KIMURA_Takuhiro.key, trunk/lgpl/fromme.email,

2006-04-24 11:26  thor

	  Further research into (non)licensed code and comnmunication.

2006-03-10 12:37  thor

	* trunk/CREDITS: some failed addresses

2006-03-10 03:22  thor

	* trunk/CREDITS: An attempt to gather a comprehensive list of
	  people who contributed to mpg123. So far not _all_ eMail
	  addresses failed;-)

2006-02-22 08:28  thor

	* trunk/JUKEBOX, trunk/README.sajber: Following a suggestion from
	  Nick, we avoid having both jukebox/ and JUKEBOX. It's a question
	  if this sajber jukebox interface will keep working anyway...

2005-12-24 00:41  thomas

	* trunk/BENCHMARKING.thor: just added my benchmark; nice to have
	  some numbers there...

	* trunk/CHANGES, trunk/README, trunk/README.thor: now also final
	  thor5 doc-wise

2005-12-24 00:07  thomas

	  Preliminary result from sessions on my (well, the university's)
	  Compaq XP1000. - introduced an extra flag to prevent equalfile
	  from being used as a bool all the time (confuses compilers and
	  is just not nice) - cared for real being whatever (float,
	  double, ...) in sscanf stuff of control_generic (mainly in my
	  added SEQ) - fixed the Alpha show-stopper: mixing up of int and
	  long pointers in getlopt

2005-02-24 20:09  thomas

2004-10-08 16:12  thomas

2004-09-21 03:58  thomas

	  trunk/control_generic.c, trunk/decode_i586.s, trunk/mpg123.c,
	  trunk/mpg123.h, trunk/test.pl, trunk/version.h: Just going to
	  put mpg123-thor in here for a start; bridge to my CVS for that
	  one. 0.59r-ThOr(remote-err,eq,flushing) - added audio_flush()
	  calls to various places in control_generic.c to make sure there
	  is nothing left in there that hurts later
	  0.59r-realeq-remoteerr: - applied patch from Cool Feet Audio
	  project (nutcase@dtfm.org, see README.cfa) to use real-time
	  equalizer in remote mode - applied patch from AMF
	  (amf.sourceforge.net) by Steve Grundell for remote communication
	  not polluting the STDOUT where the audio data is read from
	  (instead using STDERR) ... and faster seeking, maybe The patches
	  go not cleanly together, but rejects are trivial. Thus, a
	  combined patch with both would makes sense. - modified (IMHO
	  improved) the control_generic command reading: now always making
	  sure that the full command is read up to a mandatory \n; also
	  reworked the application of the commands afterwards - added SEQ
	  command: simple eq with only 3 bands - added SILENCE command: I
	  don't want the playback messages when I don't read them (since
	  my frontend is reading the STDOUT it knows what is going on) -
	  added SLJ command: SILENCE-LOAD-JUMP... a hack for my hacked
	  mixplayd... maybe one should remove that again.

2006-02-20 05:11  thor

	* trunk: Going to start with version 0.59r as the new trunk...
	  this version is the one underlying the vast majority of current

	  (buffer), too - fixed order of local variables in decode.c to
	  work around a compiler bug in ultrix - fixed Makefile for ultrix
	  - reverted to old getbits.s (the new one could cause coredumps)

	  will hear this!) - Fixed wrong values in BandInfo struct for
	  32kHz mode - Some performance improvements and minor changes and

	  1.81) package. (but it was slightly slower on my system,
	  currently disabled) 0.59f: (OF) ------ HP-UX audio fix (provided
	  by Damien Clermonte). Buffering (-b option) hopefully fixed.
	  Please test!

	  and decode*.c to allow auto-increment/decrement removed
	  bit-counter in getbit-functions. Layer3 part2 now counts it
	  itself. 0.58: (OF) ----- Bugfix: not closing the audio device
	  caused a few samples to be lost. Bugfix: audio_set_rate() was
	  not called (!?!). Additional command line options
	  "--doublespeed" and "--halfspeed" (couldn't find better names).
	  See the manpage. Complete redesign of command line options. See
	  the manpage. Changed the buffer algorithm (-b). I'm not sure
	  whether it's better or worse now. Supports multiple files on the
	  command line. Pressing Ctrl-C will skip to the next MPEG file,
	  pressing it twice within one second will abort mpg123
	  completely. See the "INTERRUPT" section in the manpage. Support
	  for http URLs. See also the -p option in the manpage. Support
	  for list files. See also the -@ option in the manpage.

	  binary. (new options -2to1,-4to1) Optimizations in the dct12.
	  Removed the 'int' version. 0.56: (OF) ----- Additional command
	  line option "-rs" to try to resync on "broken" MPEG streams (now
	  called "--resync" or "-y"). Additional command line option "-b"
	  to use audio output buffering. See the manpage for additional
	  information. Changed a few variable names and some other minor
	  fixes, so the source compiles more cleanly (without warnings) on
	  most platforms (for example, the FreeBSD port compiles without
	  warnings using "-Wall -ansi -pedantic"). Makefile changes: moved
	  "solaris" to "solaris-gcc", new target "solaris" (using Sun's
	  SparcWorks cc, faster tha gcc!), new targets "aix" and "generic".
