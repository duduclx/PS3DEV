make_self_npdrm makes valid NPDRM selfs from elfs
it does not contain any info on decrypting or removing NPDRM
NPDRM is required for interoperability of our homebrew applications
package_finalize turns your debug packages into psuedoretail packages
psuedoretail packages install on a geohot jailbroken PS3

be sure the elf you are make_self_npdrming is sprxlinked
also be careful with the output file name of make_self_npdrm
most likely, it should be "EBOOT.BIN", it is case sensitive
